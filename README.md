# Install instructions

1. Install python
Get it from official website : [here](https://www.python.org/downloads) (disable max length and add it to path)

2. Install pip

First, check if pip isn't already installed (It's supposed to, but meh.. wasn't for me)
```
pip -help
```
If you get an error like it was for me right click and save this : [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

Open a cmd, then type those command, replacing [path_to_file] by actual path you saved the file (copy paste from explorer bar) :
```
cd [path_to_file]
python get-pip.py
```
Run this command again :
```
pip -help
```
If everything worked, you're supposed to see a bunch of text telling you how to use pip.

3. Install pyautogui
Run this command in a cmd :
```
pip install pyautogui
pip install pynput
```
You'll see a of download progress bar : it's installing the package and it's dependencies.

4. Now you can run the script :

```
cd [path_to_file]
python main.py
```
